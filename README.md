Coffee machine instruction
Description
Now let's consider a case where you need a lot of coffee. Maybe, for example, you're hosting a party with a lot of guests. The program should calculate how much water, coffee, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee. One cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans.
The user should input the amount of coffee he needs, in cups, for all the guests.
Of course, all this coffee is not needed right now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn't actually make any coffee.

Instruction
Write a program that calculates the amount of ingredients needed to make a certain amount of coffee.
Please note in this case we already have repository for coffee machine we should just create separate flow for this task , don't forget about ignoring unnecessary files , adding description in the readme , adding comments , making names meaningful . Also all your methods should be small (should have singe responsibility which mean only one logic) , and parameters list shouldn't be more then 3-4 .
